						<p>Astromage: Rage of the Elements was developed as a part of my game development studies at KAMK. Our prompt was to create a "vertical slice with a challenge", and we picked developing a Virtual Reality game as our challenge. So this was not only my first VR project, it was also my first time working as a dedicated game designer.
						<br>Our team, Violet Roses, consisted of 6 members, and I was responsible for game design and audio design.
						I also created some art assets, such as the UI buttons and some 3D models, and I put together the first trailer for the game.</p>

						<p>Spinner Rush is another project I was part of during my studies at KAMK. The goal of that project was to create a 2D mobile game (programmed in C++), and not only did we succeed in creating it, we published it as well! Not on itch.io this time, but instead the Google Play Store.
						<br>Because 3 out of the 5 members of our team were programmers, and the fourth was a producer, I had to wear many hats in this project. I worked as the sole artist and Music/SFX designer, and while everyone took part in designing the game, I took a bit more incentive with that as the game concept was an idea of mine.</p>
