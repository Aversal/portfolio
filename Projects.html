								<p>Astromage: Rage of the Elements was developed as a part of my game development studies at KAMK.

								<p>Our team, Violet Roses, consisted of 6 members, and I was responsible for game design and audio design.

						<p>Spinner Rush is another project I was part of during my studies at KAMK. The goal of that project was to create a 2D mobile game (programmed in C++), and not only did we succeed in creating it, we published it as well! Not on itch.io this time, but instead the Google Play Store.</p>
						<p>Because 3 out of the 5 members of our team were programmers, and the fourth was a producer, I had to wear many hats in this project. I worked as the sole artist and Music/SFX designer, and while everyone took part in designing the game, I took a bit more incentive with that as the game concept was an idea of mine.</p>

						<p>Stellar Leap is a game project from 2019 developed by a team of five people (closer to four, to be honest.) We didn't have nearly any restraints as to what we were allowed to make, and after some brainstorming we decided to go with an idea I came up with. And so begun the development of Stellar Leap, a sci-fi physics platformer  with all the grappling hook fun.</p>
						<p>As you might be able to tell, our game drew a lot of inspiration from other games with similar gameplay, genre or the game feel we were aiming for. A Story About my Uncle is probably the closest regarding gameplay, and Portal is a prime example on how to make good physics-based platforming games, although Stellar Leap doesn't have any puzzle elements like Portal does.
						And then there's the surfing mechanic in some Counter-Strike games, which has an interesting smoothness and flow to it that we wanted to recreate in Stellar Leap (we didn't quite succeed.)</p>
