							<h2>Work history</h2>
							<p></p>
						</header>

						<p>I've been a student for the majority of my life, and I haven't had a single full-time job. But that doesn't mean that I'm not a hard working person, or that I haven't ever worked on anything. 
						<br>Most of my work history consists of either short summer job ventures or voluntary work. Currently I am also working a tutor at KAMK, where I help out new students and take part in organizing events for all students. 
						The paid gigs happened a long time ago, and they include mostly working on youth camps and painting jobs, so I’d say those are not very relevant anymore. Instead, I'd like to tell a bit more about the game industry-related voluntary work I've done!</p>
						<br><br><br>
						<h3>Kajak Games</h3>
						<br><br>
						<p>From May 2019 to May 2020, I worked as the Event Manager of Kajak Games. I organized various events aimed mostly for the students of KAMK, but alumni and other people from the industry were usually free to join as well. The events themselves ranged from game jams to game nights and sauna evenings. I also participated in other events such as Assembly and Vaasa Game Days to represent KAMK and Kajak Games, and arranged a trip to IGDA Helsinki gathering for our students.</p>
						<p>One of the best parts of my year as an Event Manager was when I organized the Global Game Jam / Finnish Game Jam 2020 event in Kajaani. It was a great experience, and I even got to be on the official GGJ stream! Another high point of the year was to be a part of organizing the NGS (Northern Game Summit), where I put together a sauna evening for the guests and was a part of the game room crew.</p>
						<br><br><br>
						<h3>IGDA Kajaani Hub</h3>
						<p>I’ve been a volunteer at the IGDA Kajaani hub since September 2019. My role has consisted mostly of helping with practical things, such as taking visitors’ names and taking care of our hardware. I’ve taken part in our hub meetings and helping in making our events the best ones possible. In any events I’ve gone to while being a volunteer, I’ve also represented our hub and IGDA in general.</p>
						<p>In Kajaani we’ve held monthly gatherings for students, industry employees and everybody interested in our activities. We’ve often had guest speakers come and give a lecture, Q&A session etc. in the gatherings, which have been great successes. Of course, the gatherings have been on hold ever since the covid-19 outbreak began in Finland in March 2019.</p>
